PROJ3 README.TXT 11/6/2019

For proj3, we were able to get to writing all of the tests, along with fixing the bugs in the .cpp board file. 

I found some difficulty debugging the code because I misunderstood what some of the parameters for the functions were, but I was able to get it done. 

I was helped by a few tutors in the CS Tutoring room in Kemper 75. We did not reference any source code for this project.

I believe everything is working properly.
